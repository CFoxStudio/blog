Hello Players,

We’ve got exciting news to share with all of you! After many years of hard work and success under our current studio name, we’re embarking on a new journey. 
Over the last few weeks we have moved mostly everything to CelestialFox.
I wanted to take a moment to explain what this change means and what you can expect from this transition.

## Why the change?
Change can be a little bit unexpected (especially after nearly a year of no updates), but it's needed. There are 2 factors that made me make this change:
1. Request from the studio with the same name
2. A fresh identity

## Why fresh identity though?
Evie had no updates since 2023. With a rewrite in Godot 4 coming (so Evie 0.1 again), it would be nice to refresh things a bit.

## What Has Changed?
**Studio Name**: We’re saying goodbye to our old name and introducing CelestialFox. It’s bold, fresh, and embodies everything we’ve become.

**Logo and Visual Identity**: Our new logo is more modern, dynamic, and reflect our passion for gaming. 
Along with the logo, we’re introducing a whole new visual style that will influence everything from our website to our game interfaces.

**Our Domain**: Instead of the old domain we're using [celestial-fox.com](https://celestial-fox.com) now!

**Our Team:** Creta left LonelyPie, so there was only 2 people. But we're starting CelestialFox Studio with 3 new people on board! (So 5 in total!)

Thank you for being part of this journey with us. Together, we’re just getting started!

We hope you’re as excited about this new beginning as we are.

- Andus
